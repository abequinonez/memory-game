# Udacity Memory Game Project

This project, a browser-based card matching game, was developed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The project guidelines called for an application that recreates the real-life functionality of card games such as Concentration and Memory, in which a pair of cards are flipped per turn in the hope of finding a match. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. After cloning or downloading this repository, open index.html in a web browser. Alternatively, you may visit the web page [here](https://abequinonez.github.io/udacity-memory-game).

2. Click on any card to start the game and start the timer.

3. Click on another card. If the cards match, they will stay open. Otherwise, both cards will reset to their closed position. This counts as one turn or move, regardless if the cards match or not.

4. Repeat this process until all cards are open and the game is won.
